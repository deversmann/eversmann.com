				<p>If your child is healthy, and passed a certain age (most books say 6 months... though I think that’s a bit young- I like to wait until the 1 year mark- but that’s a personal choice), there are few reasons why s/he shouldn’t be sleeping through the night (or at least MOST of it).  As a parent of 2, what has worked best for us is “timed interval” sleep training.  Meaning- the baby starts to cry and instead of running in the second he whimpers, we wait about 3 minutes to make sure he can’t sooth himself back to sleep.  After 2-3 minutes we go in, check on him to make sure everything is ok (this is important... you never want to just assume all is well), pat him on the bottom, and gently remind him that he needs to go to sleep on his own and we love him very much.  Then... we walk out.</p>
				<p>Guess what happens now.  He screams.  He wants us to pick him up- and he’s mad that we’re not doing that.  But we’ve all learned that picking him up, rocking him, giving him a bottle, etc... just leads to him sleeping restlessly throughout the night, unable to self-sooth, and absolutely no sleep for mom and dad either.  So instead of giving in, we start the timed interval approach.  After we have gone in that first time, we set the timer for 5 minutes... we’ll let him cry for 5 minutes and then we’ll go back in- to reassure him that we’re still here... and to make sure he’s doing ok.  We remind him how much we love him and how much we all need sleep (though I can’t say he understands a lick of what we’re saying to him).  We do not spend more than 1 minute in there... remember, the goal is to get him to fall asleep on his own- not with us standing there over him patting his bottom.  And then we walk out again.</p>
				<p>Is he going to cry again?  It depends on how often we do the sleep training... if it’s our first time he’s going to cry again... and again... and again.  If we’ve done it a few times, we may only need to go in there once or twice.  The key with this form of sleep training is that you are consistent- and that you keep going in to check on your child at the timed intervals.</p>
				<a name="common_sense"><h3>About Common Sense</h3></a>
				<p>Look, don’t be stupid. Babies under 6 months of age SHOULD be waking up in the middle of the night to eat.  Also, if your child has health issues do NOT sleep train.  We recommend talking to your pediatrician about sleep issues before you try and remedy the situation on your own.  Once you’ve gotten the “go-ahead” from the doctor, try it.</p>
				<p>Please realize that sometimes sleep training isn’t appropriate - like when the child is sick or even teething.  This method is proven to work for many families, including our own.  But it’s not for everyone.  We do not advocate neglect, or leaving your child in his or her crib to cry it out on his or her own without you checking on them.  If your child is crying and you think something may be wrong, go check!!!  Above all, baby's safety comes first!</p>
