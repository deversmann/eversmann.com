				<tr><td class="main" height="350"><img src="ben.jpg" align="left" alt="ben" />Ben and Damien met when the two of them were at UT.  Strangely, Damien was in Engineering and Ben was in Music Education.  Even stranger is the fact that neither one is completely sure which of their many meetings was the first.  Whatever the case, suffice it to say their paths continued to cross till they became friends.  For several years now, Ben has been a friend and support to Damien.  Now, as long as Ben's military service doesn't get in the way, Damien can have the honor of having Ben in his wedding.</td></tr>
