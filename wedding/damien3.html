That was short-lived though as he began to yearn again for variety and eventually gave in and returned to the University of Toledo.  But Theatre and Lighting had already been done... so this time it was Computer Science and ended in an MS in Engineering Science.  Then back to the career thing with Aeroquip, which became Eaton while Damien was there.... perhaps because he was there.  His final (as of yet) career change came when IBM hired him to be a "work-at-home computer geek", although his real title is much more boring.</td></tr>
