				<tr><td class="main" height="350"><img src="todd.jpg" align="left" alt="todd" />Todd and Damien have been friends for about 5 years.  In that time, they've done a great many things together from musical composition to road trips for musical performance, from partying hearty to being bored senseless.  Todd was there to support Damien through school, job and life changes and consequently to celebrate those changes when celebration was warranted.  Todd was once overheard saying that Damien was probably the only potential roommate he could put up with (and vice versa).  The unfortunate fact is that Damien and Todd never managed to live together... probably a good thing.  Todd has been supportive of Damien and Amanda's relationship from the start (especially since she makes Damien party more) and was the best person to represent Damien and Amanda as a couple.</td></tr>
