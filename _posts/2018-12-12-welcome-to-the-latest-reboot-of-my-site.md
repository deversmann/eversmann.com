title:  "Welcome to the latest reboot of my site!"

I'm trying to get writing again.  As is usually the case, I've gotten completely tied up
in the tooling.  The result is that I've spent far too long tweaking and messing around 
with software and tools and not enough time trying to write.  

So, the long and the short of it is what you see now.  I don't really like the look of the 
site, but whatever... at least it's up.  I'm including the few posts from the last attempt.  
Now to try to post new content regularly.
