				<h2>Welcome to CryCounter</h2>
				<p>Sleep Training has such a bad reputation... but what it really comes down to is this- <i>your baby needs sleep</i>.  <b><i>You need sleep</i></b>.  Right?  Right.  Timed interval sleep training is one solution.  If this is the decision you've made, this app is for you.  If you're searching for a solution, head over to the <a href="about/#sleep_training">About</a> page for more info and links to some resources... and then come back here!</p>
				<h3>Help in the middle of the night</h3>
				<p>This app will help you with the timed intervals.  You decide in advance how long you want to wait before you go in for the first time to check on him.  You also set how much to increase the time each interval and what your maximum wait will be.  Then, when your child wakes up and starts to cry and it's too late at night (or early in the morning) to remember which interval you're on, or even how long you've been waiting this current time, you let the application handle it for you.  Tap the clock and it starts.  When the appropriate interval has passed, it lets you know it's time to go back in.  When you come out, just tap it again.  It will handle remembering when you came out, and how long to wait this time!  You can just concentrate on your child without worrying about a clock.</p>
				<h3>Important to remember</h3>
				<p>If you've been trying sleep training, then you know to be smart about it.  Baby's safety always comes first.  So whether you're a beginner or a pro, be sure to review the <a href="about/#common_sense">Common Sense</a> section of our About page for a refresher!</p>
