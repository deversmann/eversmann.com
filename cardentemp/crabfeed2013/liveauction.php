At 30x40, this one of a kind composition created on acid-free lifetime paper with professional paints, then mounted within a gorgeous black shadowboxed frame will stand out in your home as a gallery piece.  A striking way to capture the work of Carden's growing hands while investing in stunning, one of a kind contemporary art work. </li>
