Before the Auction<br />
<span style="font-size:.75em">Listed below are a few things you should do before attending the Carden Crab Feed & Auction on March 2, 2013.</span>
<ul>
<li>Purchase your tickets to the event.  In early February, you will be receiving your ticket order form for the event.  On the order form, you will also be able to pre-order drink tickets for the event.  Please bring your completed order form with payment to the office.  The deadline for ticket orders is February 13th. There will be a website function where you can choose to sit with friends. This is also a great event to meet new people.  If you do not indicate anyone in particular, we will try to seat you with parents of kids in the same grade.</li>
<li>Check out your child's Class Project.  Classes make a large project that is donated to the auction and goes to the highest bidder on auction night. Contact your child's room parent for more information.</li>
<li>Buy a ticket for the Tuition Raffle where you could win a half a year of tuition at Carden for the 2013/2014 school year! (*We must sell a minimum number of tickets for this drawing to take place)</li>
<li>Review this website to identify the items you'd like to bid on at the auction. If you are unable to attend but would like to bid on an item, we will have a way for you to do so.  A link to the Auction Program will be posted here as the event nears.</li>
<li>Figure out what to wear!  This year the theme is the Academy Awards.  Dress up as if you are one of the lucky few attending the ceremony yourself!  Or dress up like your favorite movie character!  It is always a blast to see so many people who take the theme to heart.  But please, do not feel like you have to dress up.  Many people don't - you won't be alone!</li>
</ul>

The Night of the Auction - What to Expect<br />
<span style="font-size:.75em">To prepare you for the evening, please review the following.  As details become finalized, we will update this information.</span>
<ul>
<li>Registration: When you arrive at the red carpet, you will check in by last name at the "Registration Table" just up the short flight of stairs at the main entrance to Arden Hills. At check-in, you will receive your bid number, your dinner table name/number, and a nametag with this information. Volunteers will be double-checking your email address to ensure that you will receive your invoice/receipt after the event.  You will also be asked to provide a credit card so your final bill can be run at the end of the night. This is optional, but helps the check out process go much more quickly at the end of a long night.  There will be an â€˜Express Line' for those who have chosen this option. </li>
<li>Dessert Table: After your photo op at the end of the red carpet, you will see the Dessert Table by the bar with all of the bake-off entries and other donated desserts.  We will have a "Dessert Dash" that will have each table dashing for its dessert. Once you sit down to dinner, you will be asked to pass around a bid form and everyone can contribute towards your table's total bid on a dessert. During the Live Auction, we will read off the winners, from high to low, and a runner from each table will "Dash" for your table's dessert. (Don't forget to check out all of the amazing desserts that will be available for the Dash by the entrance.)</li>
<li>Raffle & Drink Tickets: Make sure to find our Ticket Sellers who will be walking around selling tickets for drinks & raffles.</li>
<li>Silent Auction: The Silent Auction will open at 6:00 pm and close promptly at 7:30 pm. Make your bids right away - especially for the sign-up parties because they fill up quickly!</li>
<li>Don't forget to stop by the Class Projects table to view the projects made by your own children.  These Class Projects will be auctioned off during the Live Auction.  You won't want to miss the opportunity to preserve memories that you will be able to cherish for years to come!
<li>Other things to do: Get your friends together for a picture in the Photo Kiosk, sponsored by AAMCO.  Enjoy wine tasting from local wineries and cocktails and beer from the Arden Hills bar.</li>
<li>Dinner will be served at 7:30pm, during which the "Dessert Dash" winners will be announced.</li>
<li>The Live Auction will begin at 8:45pm, and as dinner winds down, we will have the Dessert Dash.</li>
<li>If time allows, get yourself and your friends out on the dance floor to end the evening right!</li>
<li>Check Out: Before you leave, go see what you won at the Silent Auction. There will be an Express Line for those who already provided a credit card during Registration.</li>
</ul>
